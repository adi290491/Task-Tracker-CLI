# Task-Tracker-CLI
This is a basic Task Tracker CLI developed in Go. This project is a minimalistic one in the sense that there are no external libraries, or interaction with databases to manage your tasks. All the tasks are stored in a tasks.json file which is created when you first add a task.

   ```bash
   >task-cli add <description>
